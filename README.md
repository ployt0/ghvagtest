# ghvagtest

Github vagrant test.

I stopped using vagrant guests for testing a long time ago. Indeed they are slow and heavy but this repo shows they are there, supported by github actions, and a minimal example of how long they take to setup.

## Next steps

Cache, improve speed.

I have a k8s repo using vagrant, https://github.com/ployt0/vagrank8s/actions/workflows/main.yml. I guess the more advanced stuff goes there.
